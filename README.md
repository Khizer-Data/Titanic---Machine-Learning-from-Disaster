# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

## Overview 📊
This project implements a machine learning solution for the famous [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The project follows MLOps best practices using DVC (Data Version Control) for experiment tracking and model versioning.

## Data Source 📁
The dataset is sourced from the official Kaggle competition: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

### Dataset Description
- **Training Set**: 891 passengers
- **Test Set**: 418 passengers
- **Features**: Includes passenger information like class, name, sex, age, siblings/spouses aboard, parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### Missing Value Treatment
| Feature  | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Age      | Median by Title & Pclass |
| Cabin    | Binary feature + Deck extraction |
| Embarked | Most frequent value ('S') |
| Fare     | Median by Pclass |

```

### Stage Details:

1. **Data Ingestion** 📥
   - Downloads data from Kaggle API
   - Outputs: train.csv, test.csv

2. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹
   - Handles missing values:
     - Age: Imputed by Title & Pclass
     - Embarked: Most frequent ('S')
     - Fare: Median by Pclass

3. **Feature Engineering** ⚙️
   - Creates derived features
   - Performs encoding
   - Outputs engineered dataset

4. **Model Training** 🤖
   - Trains multiple models:
     - Histogram Gradient Boosting
     - Gradient Boosting
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression

5. **Model Evaluation** 📊
   - Calculates metrics
   - Generates performance plots

6. **DVCLive Tracking** 📈
   - Tracks experiments
   - Stores metrics and plots


## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|-------|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| **Histogram Gradient Boosting** | 85.11% | 81.94% | 79.73% | 80.82% | 84.16% |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 83.51% | 81.16% | 75.68% | 78.32% | 82.14% |
| **Random Forest** | 82.98% | 83.87% | 70.27% | 76.47% | 80.75% |
| **Logistic Regression** | 81.38% | 78.26% | 72.97% | 75.52% | 79.91% |
